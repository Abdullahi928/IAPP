When you carry out a project, you face constraints. Constraints are factors that may place limitations or restrictions on when the project will end, how it is carried out...

Project team structures
	1. Functional organization: There is no project manager, the head of the department takes care of the project. Employees might not know that a project is going on because they just take orders and implement them.
	2. Matrix organizations: A project manager is present and usually collaborates with the functional manager. There are different types of matrix organizations
		a. Weak matrix organizations: The functional manager is in charge. The project manager help to monitor schedules and project status but the project manager has no decision making power.
		b. Balanced organizations: The project manager is recognized to be crucial in the organization's success. Project managers have some decisions making power. They may have control over the schedules and budget and the functional manager decides how the work will be done and what will be carried out from the work done.
		c.  Strong Matrix: The project manager has much more responsibility and authority. However, they don't have all the authority over the project.
		
	3. Projectized Organizations: The project manager is the king or queen. They are the manager of the team. The team works on a specific task.

All the Organizations listed above all have their place, they are all useful.

For example, a functional organization works well In a company that doesn't run too many projects. Or projects which are not complicated or don't have a tight deadline.

Matrix organizations work well with organizations that members are assigned to multiple projects and other work.

As the project manager, you should consider a strong Matrix because that's where you have the most power.

That doesn't mean the strong Matrix is the best. A weak Matrix works best when the functional manager has all the expertise needed and just needs help with project coordination.


Balanced matrix works well when it's easy to divided responsibility between the project manager and the functional manager.


A projectized Organization works best when you have a critical project and time is of the essence. It is more expensive to run  because you a portion of the workforce on a specific project and it may disrupt other plans/projects of the organization.



Project stakeholders
A stakeholder in this context is a person or an organization that may impact your project positively or negatively.

Stakeholders are your team members, sponsors, customers.. it includes everyone involved and impacted by the project

You aren't certain about who your stakeholders are? 

Answer these question..
	1. Who asked for this project
	2. Who will use the product or service we're creating or enhancing.
	3. Who will have to change their job as a result of this project
	4. Who makes decisions about this project
	5. Who has the ability to add or take away resources from this project
	6. Who influences those that make decisions about this project

Each stakeholder is important but how do you know which ones to give more attention? Use the power/interest grid to solve this problem.

		


Make an habit of interviewing your stakeholders at the start of your project. Get to know their preference i.e. how they like to be informed, what part of the project matters most to them...
You should constantly remind your stakeholders about the importance of the project, the vision and what will be accomplished at the end.

Always keep your stakeholders engaged from start to finish.

Your stakeholders can be classified based on the engagement to need to offer.

	1. Unaware: They do not know what the project is about and the value it's providing. 
		○ You want to help them understand what the project is about  and its importance
		
		○ You want to at least make them supportive or take on a leadership role.
	2. Resistant: They know about your project but they aren't in support of it. They don't like the value of the project
		○ You want to bring them to a neutral position.
		○ You want to at least make them supportive.
		
	3. Neutral: They know about your project but they are neither supportive or resistant
		○ Depending on their power an influence, you want to make them supportive. Generally, you want to make every neutral person supportive.
		
	4. Supportive: They know about your project and are in support of what it brings.
		○ You want to make such people take on leadership roles.
	5. Leading: They know about the project and are proactively working to make it a success.
		○ You want them to keep leading
		○ Involve such people in the project's success.
		

Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix

Use the matrix above to better manage data about your stakeholders.


If a stakeholder is resistant, you may want them to work with supportive/leading stakeholders. Hopefully they get influenced.

Be proactive!
	• Engage your resistant stakeholders
	• Appreciate supportive and leading stakeholders
	• Provide open and honest communication about the project
	• Keep your stakeholders informed


Build strong professional relationships
Be trustworthy

Scope Management
From the beginning of the project, it is important for everyone (particularly stakeholders) to understand what the project is about and what it's achieving.

After a project has been approved, the first document to be created is the project charter.
The project charter announces the project and grants the project manager the authority to use organizational resources to meet project objectives.


The Project Charter will help you and your stakeholders understand 
	1. what the project will accomplish.
	2. What does it mean to say the project is successful
	3. The deadlines
	4. The budget
	5. Your authority over the project
	6. Your responsibility


What should be in the document?
Let's see the following bodies of knowledge.
	1. Scope Management: 
		○ How will you and your team determine what this project is accomplishing and what its not
		○ Who has to approve
		○ Once approved, can changes be made
		○ If changes are made, how will they be handled?
	2. Schedule management:
		○ Are there guidelines for how schedules will be made
		○ How often will the schedules be maintained
		○ Who can make changes to them
		○ What kind of scheduling information will be reported.
		○ You might even note known holidays
	
	3. Cost management:
		○ Are there guidelines for how estimates should be documi
		○ Who approves the budget
		○ What do you do if you're over or under the budget
		○ Can you ask for more money and who do you ask?
		
Another key piece of the plan is your project scope statement
	• Defines what the project is creating
	• What conditions must be met for the product to be accepted
	• Deliverables that must be created along the way.

Deliverables are secondary things you create to achieve the primary goal of the project.

Another key piece of the plan is your project exclusions
	• What the project is not creating.

Another key piece of the plan are your known project constraints
Some constraints might be deadlines, product functionalities...

Another key piece of the plan are assumptions
i.e. You expect team members to give you 50% of their time




After drafting your project scope, the next thing is to do a work breakdown structure (WBS). YOU'RE bringing your scope statements into deliverables.
